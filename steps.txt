Step 1:
Welcome the user to the game

Step 2
Tell the user to select a level, easy or hard. If the user selects easy then set the number of attempts
to 10 and if they select hard set it to 5

Step 3
Tell the user you are thinking of a number between 1 and 100.
Generate number between 1 and 100 and save it to a variable to be compared to

Step 4
Ask the user to guess the number you guessed and save as an integer to a variable.

Step 5
define a function to compare the user guess to the computer guess. if the guess is the same then game over.
If the user guess is higher tell them and if they guessed lower tell them

step 6
for each incorrect guess the user makes the number of attempts they have remaining must decrease by 1

Step 7
if the user reaches 0 guesses remaining and didn't guess the number end the game and the user loses otherwise
they have already won
